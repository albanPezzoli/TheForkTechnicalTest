# TheFork Technical Test

Good morning, good evening,

This is my technical test for the application to TheFork.
If you aren't an employee of TheFork, well you are lost on the "Internet" and github repositories

You can watch, my code can be an inspiration if you want.
But, careful, it's not perfect and it's possible you can find some ameliorations


## Demo

First of all, a little demo of my technical test :


  
## Key concepts untidily
- MVVC-C architecture
- Used Delegate, Singleton patterns
- Autolayout with anchors
- Added UIColorExtension to handle dark mode
- Handle Optional String with OptionalExtension
- Avoid backgound thread crash with onMainThread in ThreadExtension
- Introduce image caching with NSCache
- Use dependency injection with protocols to make testable
- Introduce property wrappers on UserDefaults
